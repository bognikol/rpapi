# rpapi

rpapi is a simple RPC (remote procedure call) implementation between browser and Node's express.js server, which uses TypeScript at compile time to enforce interface compatibility and auto-generated code for client and server libraries (you just implement procedures on the server and call them from the browser - it's that simple).
